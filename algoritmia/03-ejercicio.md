Multiplier
This program should ask the user for a number greater than 0 and reply with the first 20 multiples of that number.

In this example, the user inputs 5.

$ ruby multiplier.rb
My name is Multiplier and I will give you the first 20 multiples of any number
Choose a number greater than 0: 5
The first 20 multiples of 5 are:
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100
$
Notice how the program asks for the number and waits for the user input in the same line.

Also notice that before printing all the multiples it prints a message that includes the user number: "The first 20 multiples of <user_number> are:"

Finally, notice how the last multiple is preceded by the word "and". In the example "...94, 95, and 100"

Modify the file multiplier.js to meet the requirements.
