The BMI should have 2 decimal places.

Use the following ranges for the final message:

If BMI is less than 18.5 -> 'You are underweight, add more potato to the broth'

If BMI is greater than or equal to 18.5 but less than 25 -> 'You have a normal weight, I have healthy envy of you'

If BMI is greater than or equal to 25 -> 'You are overweight, I know, the pandemic has affected us all'

Assume that the user will input valid numbers.
